**Goal:** Assess the impacts of the war on agricultural lands in Gaza since the breakout of the 2023 Israel-Hamas War. We focus on two agricultural land uses: tree crops and greenhouses. $${\color{The most recent estimates included in this analysis extend through January 21, 2025}Blue}$$.

**Satellite images:** 3-m PlanetScope and 50-cm SkySat imagery Â© Planet Labs PBC obtained in 2023 and 2025

**Definitions:** Tree crops: olives, orchards, etc. Greenhouses: any crops that are covered in a structure with walls and a roof made principally of transparent material.

**Approaches:** Because tree crops and greenhouses are very different in their physical properties, I mapped their damages separately using different remote sensing algorithms. The methods of this work will be published in the journal Science of Remote Sensing (Yin et al., in press).
